# Keylogger Educational Project - README

## Project Overview

This educational project provides a comprehensive exploration of keylogger technology, focusing on ethical usage, legal implications, and cybersecurity defense mechanisms. The project is designed for educational and research purposes only.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**This project is for educational and ethical research purposes ONLY. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical. Always obtain explicit consent before monitoring any system or user activity.**

## Project Components

### 1. Keylogger Script (`keylogger.py`)
- Python-based keylogger using the `pynput` library
- Captures **keystrokes, mouse clicks, and mouse movements**.
- Features AES encryption for secure log storage.
- Designed for controlled educational environments only.

### 2. Decryption Tool (`decryptor.py`)
- Companion script to decrypt and view logged keystrokes and mouse events.
- **Saves decrypted logs to a new `.txt` file** with a timestamp (e.g., `decrypted_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`).
- Demonstrates encryption/decryption workflow.
- Essential for understanding data protection mechanisms.

### 3. Comprehensive Whitepaper (`whitepaper.md` / `whitepaper_updated.pdf`)
- In-depth analysis of legal and ethical considerations.
- Regulatory framework overview (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA).
- Case studies of keylogger misuse and consequences.
- Best practices for ethical research and implementation.

### 4. Professional Presentation
- 10-slide presentation covering keylogger functionality and defense.
- Topics include detection methods, bypass techniques, and defense strategies.
- Suitable for cybersecurity training and educational purposes.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pynput cryptography
```

### Usage Instructions

1. **Educational Use Only**: Ensure you have explicit permission to run these scripts.
2. **Controlled Environment**: Use only in isolated testing environments.
3. **Consent Required**: Never deploy without proper authorization.

### Running the Keylogger (`keylogger.py`)
```bash
python3 keylogger.py
```
*   Once executed, the keylogger will start listening for keyboard and mouse inputs.
*   It will create two files in the same directory:
    *   `secret.key`: This file stores the encryption key. **Keep this file secure, as it's essential for decrypting your logs.**
    *   `encrypted_keylog.txt`: This file will store all the captured and encrypted keystrokes and mouse events.
*   To stop the keylogger, simply press the `Esc` key on your keyboard.

### Decrypting Logs (`decryptor.py`)
```bash
python3 decryptor.py
```
*   This script will automatically look for `secret.key` and `encrypted_keylog.txt` in the same directory.
*   It will then decrypt the contents of `encrypted_keylog.txt` and save the readable logs to a new file named `decrypted_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`.
*   If either file is missing or corrupted, the script will provide an error message.

## Legal and Ethical Guidelines

### ✅ Acceptable Uses
- Cybersecurity education and training.
- Controlled research environments.
- Personal system monitoring (own devices).
- Academic research with proper oversight.

### ❌ Prohibited Uses
- Unauthorized monitoring of others.
- Corporate espionage.
- Identity theft or fraud.
- Any illegal surveillance activities.

### Legal Requirements
- **Explicit Consent**: Always required before deployment.
- **Transparency**: Users must be informed of monitoring.
- **Data Protection**: Secure storage and limited retention.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to local privacy laws and regulations.

## Educational Objectives

This project helps students and professionals understand:

1. **Technical Mechanisms**: How keyloggers capture and store data (including mouse events).
2. **Security Implications**: Potential threats and vulnerabilities.
3. **Detection Methods**: How security software identifies keyloggers.
4. **Defense Strategies**: Multi-layered protection approaches.
5. **Legal Framework**: Regulatory requirements and ethical boundaries.

## Security Considerations

### For Researchers
- Use isolated virtual machines for testing.
- Never test on production systems.
- Implement proper data destruction procedures.
- Follow institutional review board guidelines.

### For Organizations
- Establish clear monitoring policies.
- Provide employee training and awareness.
- Implement technical safeguards.
- Regular security audits and assessments.
